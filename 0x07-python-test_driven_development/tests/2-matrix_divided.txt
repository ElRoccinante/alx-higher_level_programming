"""
This module provides a function to divide a matrix by a number.

Author: [Your Name]

Date: [Date]

Usage:
    Call the matrix_divided(matrix, div) function with a matrix and a divisor to divide all elements of the matrix by the divisor.

Example:
    matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
    div = 2
    result = matrix_divided(matrix, div)
    print(result)

Output:
    [[0.5, 1.0, 1.5], [2.0, 2.5, 3.0], [3.5, 4.0, 4.5]]

def matrix_divided(matrix, div):
    """
    Divides all elements of a matrix by a given number.

    Args:
        matrix: A list of lists containing integers or floats.
                Each inner list represents a row of the matrix.
        div: A number (integer or float) used as the divisor.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If matrix is not a list.
        TypeError: If matrix is not a list of lists.
        TypeError: If matrix contains elements that are not numbers (int/float).
        TypeError: If the rows of the matrix are not of the same length.
        TypeError: If div is not a number.
        ZeroDivisionError: If div is 0.

    Returns:
        new_matrix: A new matrix with all elements divided by the div.
                    The resulting values are rounded to 2 decimal places.
